TODO_FOR_BRANCH

This branch is to provide logstash records for expired and invalid tokens.

It's been done, but not tested properly yet because webrick on local machine does not forward the request.referer.

TO complete this ticket:

 = tag the release on git (see deployment instructions on how to do that)
 - deploy tag to staging
 - see if the referrer comes through on the staging logs.
