# Introduction
Webapp to manage the workflow Parliamentary Questions

# System dependencies

- Ruby MRI 2.1.2
- Postgresql 9.3
- phantomjs  (tests only)
- coreutils (required by the `version_tag.sh` script)
- graphviz (required by the `bin/generate-erd` script)

To start with, make sure you have the right version of the Ruby runtime installed.
Multiple versions of Ruby can be managed on the same machine through either [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv)
or [rvm](https://rvm.io/).

The Postgresql version used in production is 9.3. This can be installed via [homebrew](brew.sh):

    brew install homebrew/versions/postgresql93

# Project setup

Start by setting the [required environment variables](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/parliamentary-questions/tree/dev/config).
Then Install the app dependencies by running the following

    gem install bundler && bundle install

If you get problems installing the pg gem not being able to find libpg, try setting the architecture flag as follows:

    gem install bundler && ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" bundle install

You can now procede setting up the database table layout

    bundle exec rake db:setup

Note: If you get error: FATAL: role “postgres” does not exist then double check that postgres is successfully installed and running then try this:

    createdb testDB
    psql -U <your MAC username>

  Once entered into postgres command line type this all on one line:

    CREATE ROLE postgres WITH
    LOGIN SUPERUSER INHERIT CREATEDB CREATEROLE NOREPLICATION;

  Then try the db setup command above again

And starting the app with:

    bundle exec rails s

Mock data can be automatically imported by running the following rake task:

    bundle exec rake pqa:import_dummy_data

Finally, a rake task is also provided to load PQ&A XML data into the system.

    bundle exec rake pqa:import_from_xml[path/to/question_file.xml]

# User authentication

It's done using devise and devise invitable:

* https://github.com/plataformatec/devise
* https://github.com/scambra/devise_invitable

For development you can create users with a rake task.
```
# default user
rake user:create

# specific email, password, name
rake "user:create[admin@admin.com, 123456789, admin]"
```

## Keeping secrets secure

To prevent the commitment of secrets and credentials into git repositories we use awslabs / git-secrets (https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets)

For MacOS, git-secrets can be install via Homebrew.  From the terminal run the following:

    $ brew install git-secrets

Then install the git hooks:

    $ cd /path/to/my/repo
    $ git secrets --install
    $ git secrets --register-aws

A 'canary' string has been added to the last line of the Development, Staging & Development environments secrets.yaml files.  Git Secrets has to be set to look for this string with:

    $ git secrets --add --literal '#WARNING Secrets Are Not Encrypted!'

**Please note** the string literal above should have underscores where there are spaces.  Otherwise git-secrets will look for every instance of each work in this repo.  Also by removing the underscores in this example git-secrets will not flag this file and stop all branch commits.

Finally open your local repository .git/hooks/pre-commit file and add the following command :

    git secrets --scan -r

**Please note** - Make sure the command comes before:

    git secrets --pre_commit_hook -- "$@"

So the file should look something like this:

    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    git-secrets --scan -r
    git secrets --pre_commit_hook -- "$@"

**How it works**

When committing a branch change git-secrets scans the whole repository for a specific set of strings.  In this case, the 'canary' string (described above) has been placed in all the secrets files. So if the encrypted secrets files are unlocked you will be warned before you can push the change.

# Data model

![PQ entity-relations diagram](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/parliamentary-questions/blob/dev/erd.png)

An entity-relationship diagram of PQ's data model can be generated by running
the `bin/generate-erd` script. Please do re-run this script to update the graph as
the application schema evolves.

# Running tests

Unit tests can be run via `bundle exec rspec`, while end-to-end tests can
be run be executing the same command with the features folder as argument (i.e.
`bundle exec rspec features`). Please refer to the [readme](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/parliamentary-questions/tree/dev/features) in the features folder
for end-to-end tests implementation details.

The Guard gem (https://guardgem.org/) is also installed and can be run via `bundle exec guard`.  Currently the RuboCop, RSpec, Brakeman and LiveReload plugins are setup to run when guard detects a file system modification. To use the LiveReload functionality you will need to install the LiveReload browser extension.

# Emails
Emails are sent using the [GOVUK Notify service](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk).

Please refer to the [readme](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/parliamentary-questions/tree/dev/app/mailers)in the mailers folder
for details of how to get an account and obtain an API key.
