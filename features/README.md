Cucumber features
=================

This is a spike / demo of how Cucumber features could be used on the project. There is more discussion to be held, 
but in order to not diverge the specs from the code too much, this has been merged to master.

It's not intended to run on CI for the moment.

How to run
----------

Simply run `cucumber` and that will run the scenarios. The standard Rails rake tasks have been removed, so that
they can't be accidentally run.
